Testsuites for proxies
======================

This page documents some test suites for Harmony Proxies.

  * I used to maintain a test suite that mostly covers the now obsolete [harmony:proxies](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:proxies) over at [ecmascript.org](http://hg.ecmascript.org/tests/harmony/). Not useful to test the newer direct proxies.
  
  * There is also a [v8 testsuite](https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/branches/bleeding_edge#bleeding_edge%2Ftest%2Fmjsunit%2Fharmony) for the `Proxy` implementation in v8. It too builds on the obsolete spec (old non-direct proxies), so is not useful to test direct proxies.
