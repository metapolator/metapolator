This directory contains some examples of CPS files and other
information to use with Metapolator. The examples serve many purposes
and are broken up into subdirectories to reflect this.

The purposes range from:

a) examples to help typographers get an understanding of the markup
   (if any) that is needed after importing a UFO font into
   Metapolator. As of September 2014 it is uncertain how much and what
   process will be followed to hand markup fonts for use with
   metapolator. For example, working out how changes to the xheight
   will impact the skeleton of font glyphs.

b) trivial examples which have little use as fonts but are informative
   to new developers looking to join the project and wishing to
   understand how CPS works and can be applied

As Metapolator is currently under heavy development the initial focus
will likely be on (b).

Regardless of how the examples are intended to be used, the raw
"source files" for the examples will all be kept in the /data/fonts/
directory tree. These source files can range from otf through ufo
files. The later bring ufo files that may have been generated wiht
FontForge.
